<h2 id="about">About</h2>

The Gunjala Gondi script is used by the [Gondi (Adilabad) language](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/wsg) of South Asia. This script has been in [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U11D60.pdf) since Unicode 11 but dates back to 1750. It was named after Gunjala, the village where Professor Jayadhir Tirumal Rao, a visiting professor at the Centre for Dalit and Adivasi Studies and Translation (CDAST), discovered an ancient hand-written manuscript. CDAST is a department of Hyderabad Central University (HCU) in India, where scholars are working to increase use of the Gunjala Gondi script, also known as Koytura Gunjala lipi. Teaching materials and textbooks are now in use in schools in the Gondi-speaking villages of Adilabad District.

*Narnoor* is a Unicode font based on typographer S. Sridhara Murthy’s original font for the Gunjala script. With the generous permission of CDAST at HCU we have re-engineered and released this font under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL). The name “Narnoor” reflects the name of the mandal in Adilabad district of Telangana, where the Gunjala Gondi script is actively being revived.

This [Type Sample](https://software.sil.org/downloads/r/narnoor/Narnoor-Font-Sample.pdf) document demonstrates the characters and a sample text.

## Data Conversion

A compiled and uncompiled TECkit conversion table can be downloaded which maps data using the *Devanagari script to the Gunjala Gondi* script. This map can be used with [TECkit](https://software.sil.org/teckit/) and/or [SIL Converters](https://software.sil.org/silconverters/). It has been minimally tested.

A compiled and uncompiled TECkit conversion table can be downloaded which maps data using the *Telugu script to the Gunjala Gondi* script. As above, this map can be used with [TECkit](https://software.sil.org/teckit/) and/or [SIL Converters](https://software.sil.org/silconverters/). It has also been minimally tested.

## Keyboarding

Narnoor can be used with any Unicode Gunjala keyboarding program. Mark Penny’s freely downloadable [Gunjala Gondi keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/gondi_gunjala) for iPhone and iPad, Linux, macOS, Android, Windows, Mobile web, and Web is based on a phonetic representation of the script.
