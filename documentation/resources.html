    </header>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and character set support</h2>
    <p>These fonts do not include keyboards or other software for entering text. To type the symbols in these fonts use the keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. SIL’s <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> provides keyboards for over 2000 languages and works on all major desktop and mobile platforms. For information on other keyboarding options see the overview at <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems Overview (ScriptSource)</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details of the Unicode characters supported by these fonts.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application support</h2>
    <p>The Narnoor font has been tested to work on Microsoft Word, Notepad, LibreOffice, Adobe InDesign, Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. There may be some settings which must be modified in order for the font to work. For example, in Microsoft Word, go to the <em>Font / Advanced</em> menu and select <em>Ligatures / All</em>. In Adobe InDesign, select <em>Paragraph / Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer</em>.</p>
    <p>Narnoor is designed to work with OpenType advanced font technologies. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for OpenType. In particular, Affinity Publisher probably does not have the needed OpenType support.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of these fonts (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS demo page is also included. For more information on the options and techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a href="http://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>These fonts are encoded according to <a href="http://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a>. If you have text that uses a legacy, non-Unicode encoding there are tools that can help you convert that text for use with Unicode fonts. See <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
